Leaflet Challenge  Repository

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day,
but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public
and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
